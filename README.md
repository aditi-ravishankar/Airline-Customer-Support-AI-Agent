# SkyWings Chatbot

The SkyWings Chatbot is an advanced AI-powered assistant designed to enhance customer service for the SkyWings airline.

Leveraging a powerful Large Language Model (LLM), the chatbot is capable of understanding various user intents. It also handles sub-intents, ensuring that each interaction is accurately interpreted.

The chatbot goes a step further by analyzing the sentiment of the user's input.

Additionally, the chatbot is integrated with backend systems to perform real-time actions, such as making flight bookings and processing cancellations based on the userâ€™s request. This combination of LLM-driven intent recognition, sentiment classification, and automated action triggers makes the SkyWings Chatbot a seamless, efficient, and personalized solution for airline customer support.
